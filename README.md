# Push or Pull ?

After connecting Troglio to your Trello account, you are asked to setup a destination for your data. By default, Troglio only **pushes** data to this destination. In most cases, this is fine because one can take advantage of CI pipelines to trigger builds whenever new data arrives in their git.

However, if you prefer **pulling** data, you can easily send them to a server that will act as your API endpoint. There are two different approches to do that:
1. Send data to a git repository, like github, that will trigger a CI build responsible for publishing `.json` files (to github pages, netlify, or any CDN...).
2. Send data to a custom server accepting POST requests, that will store data then serve them through a JSON API. [Here is an Express project for you to get started](https://github.com/Troglio/express-nedb-endpoint).

# Previews

Previews is a neat feature that allows one to instantly see changes before publishing them live. This is not a mandatory option, but is for sure a must-have for writers and marketers. For it to work, it requires a separate **url** to be setup. The **url** is nothing more than the **domain** of the website. For example, if the final website lives at `https://mydomain.com`, just put this **url** in the related setup (by clicking the `Preview` button in any card for the first time, or by going in the power-up's settings).

**How it works ?**
Basically, Troglio will create JSON pages out of Trello cards right in the browser. When a user requests a preview, Troglio opens an iFrame containing both the corresponding page + the new data.

As a developer it means that, when your website is opened through an iFrame, you should intercept these new data and propagate them accordingly to fill your templates, live.

If you use a Javascript framework (like React), it is a piece of cake: just catch the new data and propagate them into your routes as new props. [Here is a snippet illustrating the point](https://github.com/Troglio/troglio-starter-preact-static/blob/master/src/App.js) **(PAY ATTENTION TO COMMENTS)**.
