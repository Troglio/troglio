# Starters & Tutorials

- [A basic blog with Trello](https://github.com/Troglio/troglio-starter-preact-static)
- [A minimal API endpoint with Node.js + Express + Nedb](https://github.com/Troglio/express-nedb-endpoint)


# Getting started

Go to [Trello.com](https://trello.com) and add the `Troglio` power-up to a board.

Follow the getting started.


# Push or Pull ?

After connecting Troglio with your Trello account, you are asked to setup a destination for your data. By default, Troglio only **pushes** data to this destination. If you prefer **pulling** data, [here is a starter](https://github.com/Troglio/express-nedb-endpoint) that will receive the data and serve them through an API you can *pull* from.

# Previews

Previews is a neat feature that allows one to instantly see website changes like if they were live. This is not a mandatory option, but is for sure a must-have for writers and marketers. It requires a separate **url** to be setup once. The **url** is nothing more than the domain of the website. For example, if the website lives at `https://mydomain.com`, just put this **url** in the related setup (by clicking the `Preview` button in any card for the first time, or by going to the power-up settings).
